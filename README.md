# pokemon-game

There are a lot of issues with this code in it's current state. It is not the complete vision, but instead a proof of concept. As the code currently stands, it demonstrates that health values can be manipulated with a button press. If expounded upon, this could turn into a full fledged pokemon battle sim, but due to time constraints and current skill level, this is currently not possible if I want to turn this in before school is over. 

The code succesfully implements all 4 principles taught in class. 

To mention the pokemon.cs file, it was supposed to handle the turn order logic, and player/computer choices. For example, I wanted the a method to loop through the sorted(by speed) dictionary created in Cast.cs. The loop would stop on each entry, and wait for user input based on button press. Math would be done, and health values would be changed (hence the dictionary). My biggest issue was figuring out how to make the code wait for a button press. All my attempts led to nothing happening. Button presses would not change values. I am at a complete loss on how to resolve this. What is left of the Pokemon.cs file is the corpse of several attempts to fix this. 

I think I will need to do further research on structure and how to impliment code that would change on button press. 

I ended up taking the parts that worked, and put them into the GUI and it works that way.

I will continue to work on this project in the future. I would like to pm the completed project one day.
